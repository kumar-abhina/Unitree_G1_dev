"""
hanger_boot_sequence.py – utility to bring a hanging Unitree G-1 from
power-on (Damp) to a balanced stand ready for walking.  The helper will now
detect when the robot is already in that balanced stand (FSM-200) and simply
return the client immediately, avoiding a redundant second bring-up cycle.

Call `hanger_boot_sequence()` from any script and it returns an initialised
`LocoClient` instance that is already in FSM-200.  The helper now performs a
sanity-check after the leg-extension sweep: if the firmware still reports
“feet unloaded” (mode = 2) we pause, print a warning and wait for the
operator to tweak the hanger height and press <Enter>.  The sweep is then
repeated until mode 0 (feet loaded) is observed.  All parameters are
optional and identical to those we used during development.
